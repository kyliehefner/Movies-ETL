# Movies ETL
## Purpose
The purpose of this project was to create an automated data pipeline that extracts data from multiple sources, transforms the data, and then loads the data in SQL database tables. I took three movie data files and cleaned each data set thouroughly, merged them together, and loaded the result into a PostgreSQL database.
